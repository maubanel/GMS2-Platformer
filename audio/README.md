##### `Step 1.`\|`PLTFRMR`|:small_blue_diamond:

Open up **P4v**.  Select the top folder of the **GameMaker** project. Press the <kbd>Checkout</kbd> button.  Checkout out all files in P4V so that they are all writable (otherwise they will be read only and none of the changes will be saved). Select a **New** changelist and add a message describing the unit of work you will be performing. Press the <kbd>OK</kbd> button.

Open up the project you are working on in **GameMaker**. 

![checkout files and create new changelist](images/checkoutFiles.png)

##### `Step 2.`\|`PLTFRMR`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Lets start by adding music to **obj_game**.  We should also make **obj_game** persistent as well so we have a **HUD** in level 2.

![make obj_game persistent](images/persistent.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 3.`\|`PLTFRMR`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Download [EggyToast_7.mp3](images/EggyToast_7.mp3).  This was downloaded from **https://freemusicarchive.org/genre/Chiptune** and is from **Eggy Toast**.  The song is called **7**.

![download EggyToast_7.mp3](images/eggyMusic.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 4.`\|`PLTFRMR`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

*Right click* on **Sounds** and select **New | Sound** and name it `snd_music`.  Press the **...** and select `EggyToast_7.mp3`.

![add snd_music with EggyToast_7l.mp3](images/getSndMusic.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 5.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :small_orange_diamond:

Open up **obj_game | Create** event.  Check to see if music is playing, if it is not then play the song as priority `1` and looping set to `true`.

![obj_game play music](images/objGameCreateMusic.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 6.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Now turn on the volume and you should hear the music in this video.

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 7.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Find a suitable jump sound or download this one from [Jeremy Sykes on freesoun.org](https://freesound.org/people/jeremysykes/sounds/344500/).  Create a new sound file called `snd_jump` and bind the sound to it.

![download jump sound](images/sndJump.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 8.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Open up **obj_player | Step** event and look for the jump code.  We will play the sound in both the first ground jump and double jump.  We will minimize repetition of the exact same sound by randomly modulating the pitch (frenquency) and gain (volume) of the sound before playing it.

![play jump sound](images/objJumpAdd.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 9.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Unmute the audio to hear the jumping sounds!

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 10.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond:

Now lets add a [fall sound](https://freesound.org/people/broumbroum/sounds/50543/).  Download the prior link or find your own sfx.  Now create a new **Sound** asset and link the sound.

![add fall sound](images/sndFall.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 11.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Open up **check_for_sound**.  Now look for where we lift the player outside the ground.  We will put in a pitch and volume shifted landing sound there. We do that for both objects and tile backgrounds.

![fall sound for player](images/checkForSound.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 12.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

This exposes a bug we have caused.  The player now constantly falls when going down on the moving platform. Open up **check_fro_ground** and adjust the player y when colliding with a platform moving downwards.

![check for ground fix](images/checkForGroundFix.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 13.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Now jump and land.  It should make a sound on both tiles and object ground planes.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5504953/158837594-d3da5aec-89a9-468d-9299-2039f3a2c469.mp4

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 14.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Now lets add a [footstep sound](https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/sounds/515783/).  Download the prior link or find your own sfx.  Make sure it is a single footstep. Now create a new **Sound** asset and link the sound.

![import footstep sound](images/footstepSound.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 15.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

Open up **obj_player | End Step** and look for where we pick the run animation.  The footstep sound will only play when running.  Intead of calling the sound we will have a slight delay so that the footsteps don't play too close to each other.  In this sound I picked a 3 frame delay seems right.  When the sound is no longer playing call **alarm 5**.

![call alarm 5 when footstep not playing](images/endStepFootsteps.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 16.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond:   :small_blue_diamond: 

Press the <kbd>Add Event</kbd> and select a **Alarm | Alarm 5** event. This event fire off quiet footsounds with a slight change in pitch and volume.

![play footstep sound](images/alarm5.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 17.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Now we have a nice footstep sound.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5504953/158837665-999c146c-f98c-4088-881f-06d964080a42.mp4

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 18.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now lets add a [health damage sound](https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/sounds/399904/).  Download the prior link or find your own sfx.  Make sure it is a single hit sound. Now create a new **Sound** asset and link the sound. Call it `snd_hit`.

![add damage sound to game](images/sndHurt.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 19.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

We can kill two birds with one stone by placing the sound in **obj_player | Alarm 0**.  This is called for both the spike damage and the fire enemy damage.

![acall audio in alarm 0 for hit](images/alarm0.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 20.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond:

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Now take damage and you should hear a sound reaction.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5504953/158838128-fed51751-6cfb-47b0-abb0-44788fb7d0ee.mp4

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 21.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now lets add a [death sound](https://freesound.org/people/Fupicat/sounds/475347/).  Download the prior link or find your own sfx. Now create a new **Sound** asset and link the sound. Call it `snd_death`.

![import death sound](images/SndDeath.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 22.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now we switch to the death animation in Alarm 3 so lets trigger the sound there.

![trigger death sound alarm 3](images/alarm3Death.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 23.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Now kill yourself to hear the sound.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5504953/158843691-2d3e4c27-1e2e-4536-9774-33fb6df64907.mp4

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 24.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now lets add an [exit sound](https://freesound.org/people/DWOBoyle/sounds/143607/).  Download the prior link or find your own sfx. Now create a new **Sound** asset and link the sound. Call it `snd_exit`. Trigger the exit sound in the **obj_player | Collision | obj_exit**.  Make sure the sound only plays once as the player keep colliding.

![add exit sound](images/sndExit.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 25.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

Now *press* the <kbd>Play</kbd> button in the top menu bar to launch the game. Go to the exit and hear the sound.  That is all for this walk through, now go make some interesting platforming levels!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5504953/158844925-65157c6b-d340-4911-84d0-86bd7c301639.mp4

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 26.`\|`PLTFRMR`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Select the **File | Save Project**, then press **File | Quit** (PC) **Game Maker | Quit** on Mac to make sure everything in the game is saved.

Open up **P4V**.  Select the top folder and press the **Add** button.  We want to add all the new files we created during this last session.  Add these files to the last change list you used at the begining of the session. Make sure the message accurately represents what you have done. Press the <kbd>OK</kbd> button.

![add new and changed files to p4v](images/add.png)
